## Release 2.3.0

### Security fixes

* By default, do not expose Weave "/status" and "/report" to all (0.0.0.0) when
  running on Kubernetes #3271

### Other improvements

* Increase the default connection limit for Weave peers (from 30 to 100) when
running on Kubernetes, so that more peers could directly connect #3265

## Build and test

* Build Weave Net with Go 1.10.1 #3273
* Run integration tests against Kubernetes 1.10.0 #3266

## Release 2.2.1

### Bug fixes

* Fix a bug in weave-npc which would allow ingress traffic to Kubernetes Pods selected
  by a NetworkPolicy in which source and destination selectors were the same #3222,#3237
* Fix a bug in weave-npc which would crash if a previously deleted Kubernetes Namespace
  has been created again #3247,#3250

### Other improvements

* Increase the default connection limit for Weave peers (from 30 to 100), so that
  more peers could directly connect #3234
* When doing a rolling update of Weave Net on Kubernetes, allow each node five seconds
  to initialize before rolling next Weave Net Pod, so that issues at startup will halt
  the rollout and not spread across the whole cluster #3235
* Install common CA certificates from Alpine Linux package instead of copying
  them manually #3236

## Release 2.2.0

This release improves the way Weave Net configures Linux network
devices and network filter rules, so that it is more robust in the face
of unexpected changes in its environment. #3204,#3224

As a consequence of these changes, the `weave attach` command will now
fail unless the Weave Net daemon is up and running - previously it was
possible to run independently as long as you managed all IP addresses
yourself.

## Other improvements

* Update library miekg/dns for CVE-2017-15133 (details under embargo) #3223,#3227
* Reduce the volume of logging from weave-npc #3183
* Add ability to set log level for Docker "v2" plugin, and change
  default log level from DEBUG to INFO #3197
* Downgrade log messages about Discovery and Expiration to DEBUG level #3202,#3203
* Use command-line parameter for WeaveDNS address in Docker proxy #3196

## Bug fixes

* Ensure that rules to block traffic for NetworkPolicy are placed
  ahead of rules that Kubernetes has added to allow other traffic #3209,#3210

## Build and test

* Update CI tests to use Kubernetes 1.9.2 #3229
* Remove "daily update" from test VMs that only run for a few minutes #3224

connectivity #3190, #3192

## Release 2.1.2

This release fixes a couple of bugs discovered since the release of Weave Net 2.1.0

##Bug fixes

* Fix crash seen when starting 10-15 nodes simultaneously #3184,#3186

## Release 2.1.1

As 2.1.0, but fixing a couple of installation glitches. #3175,#3176

## Release 2.1.0

##New Features

Improved Kubernetes Network Policy - Weave Net now supports the
'v1' policies introduced in Kubernetes 1.7 as well as the 'beta'
policies supported previously. See [Kubernetes 1.7 changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.7.md#network)
for differences. To use old policies, `--use-legacy-netpol` argument
should be passed to `weave-npc`. #3105,#3141,#3151,#3169

Weave Net now reclaims IP addresses owned by Kubernetes nodes which
have been deleted from the cluster - this avoids running out of IP
addresses when many nodes are added and deleted over a long period.
#2797,#3149,#3170,#3172

##Other improvements

* Export a Prometheus-style metric giving count of unreachable peers #3119
* Update 'gopacket' library to reduce memory use by approx 15MB #3160
* Replace bundling the 'docker' binary with our own code to avoid
  security vulnerability alerts and save space #2957,#3110

##Bug fixes

* When `weave expose` is used, allow traffic into the Weave network -
  up till version 1.12 Docker would do this for us, but in 1.13 they
  stopped so now we do it. This change makes `weave expose` require
  Weave Net to be running. #2758,#3122
* Arm64 build now works on non-kubernetes installs #2832,#3110
* TX offload was being disabled in 'awsvpc' mode, which slows down packet sending #3089
* Removed spurious 'nil' in logs from CNI DEL operation #3143

##Build and test

* Images are now also built for the ppc64le platform #3129
* Tweak build scripts to run on OSX as well as Linux #3135

## Release 2.0.5

Bug fixes

* Fix /etc/hosts inside containers so the container's name resolves to
  its Weave Net address #3136,#3138
* New weave-kube config for Kubernetes 1.7 and 1.8 which resolves an
  intermittent conflict with kube-proxy that could break Weave Net
  until reboot #2998,#3134
* Remove persistence file in `weave reset` when using Docker plugin V2 #3103,#3114

Build and test

* Some trivial changes to placate go-lint #3137

[Full list of changes](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/milestone/62?closed=1).


## Release 2.0.3

Bug fixes

* Weave-npc would crash on a policy with no 'from' part - regression introduced in 2.0.2 #3095,#3096,#3097

[Full list of changes](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/milestone/61?closed=1).


## Release 2.0.2

Bug fixes and minor improvements

* Fix race condition in weave-npc which would intermittently block all traffic for a namespace  #3057,#3059
* Ensure Fast Datapath works on machines that need to mount the kernel module dynamically #3080
* Regression: weave-npc would block everything if `kubelet --hostname-override` was used #3049,#3051
* Fix netfilter rules to block containers from accessing the Weave Net control endpoint #3093
* If DNS server is off then disable proxy DNS registration, to avoid spurious errors #3054,#3088
* Add comments to each iptables rule and ipset, to help when troubleshooting #3064
* Remove code that checked for an outdated fallback address for Kubernetes api-server #3071
* Add a label to the weavedb image so it can be filtered out by tools #3066
* Fix various build and continuous-integration failures #3061
* Print 'help' text faster in the weave script #3056
* Add an option to create continuous integration hosts in different ways  #3060
* Remove remnants of the pre-2.0 proxy and plugin from build and test #3035,#3036

[Full list of changes](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/milestone/60?closed=1).


## Release 2.0.1

Bug fixes and minor improvements

* Fall back to slower data path (`sleeve`), rather than crashing, when the machine lacks VXLAN support (required for “fast data path”, `fastdp`)  #3043
* Fix bug in processing of arguments when Docker has TLS enabled, rather than crashing with invalid peers list, e.g. `lookup --tlsverify: no such host` #3039
* Add `kube-system` namespace back to `weave-kube`'s YAMLs, preventing omissions leading to errors like `error contacting APIServer: the server does not allow access to the requested resource` #3033,#3042
* Fix release script to prevent ARM64 binaries to end up in AMD64 `net-plugin`, leading to `Error response from daemon: dial unix /run/docker/plugins/<id>/weave.sock: connect: no such file or directory` when installing `net-plugin` #3045
* `weave reset` and `weave rmpeer` now only contact Weave Cloud when Weave Net is configured with a Weave Cloud token, preventing unnecessary requests and potentially confusing `401 Unauthorized` errors in Weave Net’s logs #3044

[Full list of changes](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/milestone/58?closed=1).


## Release 2.0.0

New Features

Peer Discovery via Weave Cloud

You can now get all your Weave Net peers to find each other via the
Weave Cloud service, instead of maintaining a list of peers at
startup. #2799,#2827

See the [docs
page](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/blob/master/site/using-weave/weave-cloud.md)
for more details

New Docker Plugin

Docker has a [new plugin
system](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/) which improves the
installation UX and solves some issues around startup.  This means
Weave Net 2.0 can now run with Docker in "swarm mode" and supports the
`docker service` command. #2396,#2397,#2651,#2727,#2805,#2816,#2905,
#2906,#2929,#2932,#2945,#2950,#2956,#2963,#2964,#2966,#3019

The previous Docker Plugin is still available and can be installed as before.

All of Weave Net now runs in one container

Previously we had three separate containers for routing, Docker API
proxy and Docker plugin. Running everything in one simplifies start-up
and removes the need to detect various error
conditions. #1642,#2897,#2936,#2945,#2946,#2951,#2960

The individual commands ‘weave launch-router’, ‘weave launch-plugin’,
etc., have been removed. You can turn off the plugin and proxy with
new command-line options. In keeping with Semantic Versioning, we have
changed the major version number for this release.

Other new features

* Kubernetes configuration now comes from our “Launch Generator” that
  allows different options to be selected via
  URL. #2754,#2903,#3000,#3001
* `weave-kube` now stores data about IP allocation in `/var/lib/weave`
  on the host instead of in a Kubernetes volume.  This means that the
  data will persist across pod deletion and re-creation, e.g. during
  an upgrade of Weave Net, which makes restarts more
  reliable. #2610,#2967
* `weave-kube` turned on rolling updates, so careful manual handling
  of updates is no longer required. #3024

Bug fixes

* Kubernetes Network Policies which allowed a specific set of pods to
  connect would block all pods on other hosts. Revert the change in
  v1.9.6 which ignored pods on other hosts #3025,#3028

Features removed

* `weave run` has been removed.  This was the original method provided
  to start containers with Weave Net, but it always required care over
  timing of start-up, and we now provide three alternative, better,
  ways. You can replicate the effect by calling `docker run` then
  `weave attach`.  Similarly `weave start` and `weave restart` were
  removed. #2353,#2885
* Everything deprecated more than one release ago has been removed, so
  if you use it now you get an error rather than a warning. This
  includes the ‘create-bridge’ command and older command-line
  arguments, e.g. `--iprange` was replaced by `--ipalloc-range`
  #2901,#2909,#2913,#2942,#2989,#2991

Functions moved from shell-script to Go code.

This enables more precise error-checking and runs a bit faster. It has
also enabled us to shrink the size of images downloaded: `weave-kube`
is 101MB compared to 163MB previously #2953,#2954,#2974

Specific items that moved from shell-script to Go:
* Setting up the `weave` bridge #1958,#2975,#2977,#2978
* Container attachment #2947
* Creation of the ’weave’ default plugin network #2920

Minor improvements

* You can now restart the Weave Net router without requiring the proxy to be enabled #2112
* Plugin (legacy version) now respects `--ipalloc-default-subnet` option #2919
* The `weave` script now detects and issues an error message if
  `weave-kube` is running and you attempt to launch again from the script. #2709/#2966
* It is now possible to choose the the MAC address of the `weave`
  bridge using `--name`, in case your hosts have identical unique
  IDs. #2900
* Relaxed Kubernetes tolerations for Weave Net's daemonset in order to
  match any node (previously, only taints directed at master). #3018
* Kubernetes' `seLinuxOptions` configuration is now empty by default,
  to reduce spurious failures on hosts not using seLinux. #3001
* Improved reliability of namespace changes via `nsenter`. #2992
* `weave ps` now fetches the list container IDs internally, rather
  than calling out to `docker ps` #2814,#2898
* at startup, actively remove dead containers’ Weave Net IP addresses from IPAM #3013
* at startup, only check live containers to see if they have an
  existing Weave Net IP address #2815,#2829
* Weave Net CNI plugin now logs but does not raise an error if
  anything goes wrong during network interface delete, to be more
  compatible with Kubernetes 1.6. #2928
* Stop running a shell in “privileged” mode when it’s only writing a file #2838
* New internal REST endpoint to return all IP address mappings. #1350
* Changed the wording where we do not log the password #2833
* Fixed typo in plugin error messages #2894

Build and test

* Weave Net is now built with Go version 1.8, which has better code
  generation and garbage collection #2914
* During smoke-tests, use a webserver instead of just `ping` so we get
  a more realistic test that the Weave network is working #2918
* When installing dependencies for the build container, use a
  keyserver port that's better for firewalls #2812
* Kubernetes test script now scales up to more hosts, and works with
  Kubernetes 1.6 #2837,#2853,#2923
* Other minor build improvements and refactoring #2760,#2910

[Full list of changes](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/milestone/49?closed=1).

## Release 1.9.7

This is identical to 1.9.6 with one additional bug-fix:

* weave-npc would block everything if `kubelet --hostname-override` was used #2995,#2996

## Release 1.9.6

Bug fixes and minor improvements

* Ensure that Kubernetes pods can contact a service implemented within
  the same pod, by turning on "hairpin mode". This is required because
  of a quiet change between Kubernetes 1.5 and 1.6. #2993
* Network Policy Controller (`weave-npc`) now checks local addresses
  only, so it doesn't interfere with cross-cluster traffic. It should
  be more efficient too #2622,#2973,#2979
* Stop reporting back to Kubernetes any issues encountered when
  deleting a pod's network interface. This is required because
  of a quiet change between Kubernetes 1.5 and 1.6. #2921,#2928
* Fixed an issue whereby `weave-npc` couldn't start because one
  `ipset` was referring to another one and could not be destroyed #2915,#2949
* Improved the code which checks whether the kernel supports `ipset` #2934,#2935
* `weave-npc` now creates ipsets with only valid xml characters in the
  name #2958,#2959

Build and Testing

* In build container use cross-compilers from debian package
  repository, so they match other components #2940
* Pin the version of the linting tool `shfmt` so the set of things it
  checks is stable #2987
* Fix lint error in script that runs smoke-tests #2962
* Moved website publishing from Wordpress to Netlify #2986

[Full list of changes](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/milestone/55?closed=1).

  only supports IPv4 #2904/#2912
* Fix rare crash during initialization of weave-kube #2893/#2892
* Include overlay and encryption modes in checkpoint reports, in case
  this is relevant to a version upgrade #2771/#2907

Build and Testing

* Ensure CI build can run gcloud tools  #2887
* Prevent kubeadm from upgrading Kubernetes if we are trying to test an older version #2886
* Upgrade build scripts to support Kubernetes 1.6 #2880

[Full list of changes](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/milestone/54?closed=1).

## Release 1.9.4

Bug fixes and minor improvements

* Support Kubernetes 1.6 by creating a new DaemonSet #2777,#2801
* Support Kubernetes 1.6 by allowing CNI callers to send a
  network-delete request for a container that is not running or has
  never been attached to the network #2850
* Leave non-weave ipsets alone in Network Policy Controller (e.g. when
  running Weave Net alonside keepalived-vip) #2751,#2846
* Fix various small issues revealed by 'staticcheck' tool #2843,#2857
* Avoid leaving 'defunct' processes when weave-kube container restarts #2836,#2845
* When using the CNI plugin with a non-standard network configuration
  file, the weave bridge could get the same IP as a container, if
  'weave expose' hadn't run at that point #2839,#2856

Build and Testing

* Check that no defunct processes remain after each test #2852
* Update build and test scripts to work with Kubernetes 1.6 beta #2851

[Full list of changes](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/milestone/53?closed=1).

## Release 1.9.3

Bug fixes and minor improvements

  kernel #2820/#2821
* Detect the absence of the required `xt_set` kernel module #2821

## Release 1.9.1

Bug fixes and minor improvements

* Fix a race condition when the Weave Net container is restarted
  which could allow a new container to be allocated the same IP
  address as an existing one #2784,#2787
* Handle the message type received when a pod has been deleted during
  Kubernetes api-server fail-over #2772,#2773
* Make weave-kube work with `dockerd --iptables=false` #2726

  larger clusters can be created #2781
* WeaveDNS was incorrectly case-sensitive for reverse DNS lookups #2817,#2818

Build and Testing

* Scripts to create VMs to run automated tests were rewritten to use
  Terraform and Ansible, to make it much easier to test with different
  versions of components such as Docker and Kubernetes #2647,#2694,#2775,#2796
* Upgrade to latest Weaveworks common build-tools #2780
* Improve encryption tests #2793
* Update vishvananda/netlink library to bring in changes we had previously forked #2790
* Slight change to the build container to avoid permission errors and slow builds #2761,#2802

## Release 1.9.0

Highlights:

* Encryption is now available for Fast Datapath connections, which
  greatly improves the performance. #1644,#2687

* Weave Proxy did not flush the initial http header in the Docker event stream, which could cause Docker Swarm to show all nodes pending. #2306/#2311
* When using the CNI plugin, if a container was removed and quickly replaced by another using the same IP address, other containers might be unable to contact it. Send an address resolution protocol message to update them. #2313
* Avoid Docker hanging for 1 minute in `weave launch` if the plugin had not shut down cleanly #2286/#2292
* Print an error message when Weave bridge mode is changed without `weave reset` #2304
* Eliminate spurious warning message from IP allocator on plugin shutdown #2300/#2319
* Display error message when address requested in a subnet that is too small (/31 or /32) #2282/#2321
* Add short wait after `weave reset` to allow updates to reach peers #2280
* Weave was occasionally unable to claim existing IP address immediately after launch #2275/#2281
* Refactor some integration tests to run faster and more reliably #2291

## Release 1.5.1

Bug fixes and minor improvements

* Persisted data that was rendered invalid by changing peer name or
  allocation range is detected and removed automatically, preventing
  crashes and hangs #2246/#2209/#2249
* `weave rmpeer` persists the range takeover in case the peer on which
  it was executed dies subsequently #2238
* Launching a container with an explicit `WEAVE_CIDR` in the
  allocation range now waits instead of erroring if the allocator
  hasn't finished initialising #2232/#2265
* Weave DNS now responds to AAAA queries with an empty answer section,
  instead of NXDOMAIN which could be cached and block subsequent
  resolution of A records #2244/#2252
* Many improvements to the documentation.

## Release 1.5.0

## Highlights

- A new [Container Network Interface](https://github.com/appc/cni#cni---the-container-network-interface) plugin.
- This release is much more robust against unscheduled restarts,
  because it persists key data to disk.
- New configuration options that are useful when you create or
  auto-scale larger networks.
- Weave now periodically checks for updates (can be disabled)

Plus many bug fixes and minor enhancements. More details below and in
the [change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.5.0).

## Release 1.4.6

Fixes some issues encountered by our users.

* Restarting a peer could leave stale entries in WeaveDNS
  #1867/#2023/#2081
* Weave proxy occasionally failing to attach any new containers
  #2016/#2049

Other fixes:

* Resolved a crash when a restarting peer re-connected to a peer that
  had not received the latest IPAM data #2083/#2092
* Make IP address space available immediately after a dead peer is
  removed #2068

## Release 1.4.5

Higher performance for multicast and broadcast traffic when using
Weave's Fast Datapath

* The flow rule to deliver broadcast and multicast packets in-kernel
  was not created correctly, hence every such packet caused a
  context-switch to the software router #2003/#2008

Other fixes:

* Remove DNS entries for containers that are being restarted by Docker
  but are not live yet #1977/#1989
* Don't let one failing allocation attempt prevent others from
  succeeding; they could be in different subnets which are more
  available #1996/#2001
* Don't complain on second router launch on kernels that lack support
  for Fast Datapath #1929/#1983
* Fix build broken by change in libnetwork IPAM API #1984/#1985

## Release 1.4.4

Fixing a rather serious issue that slipped through our preparations
for Docker 1.10:

* Restarting Docker or rebooting your machine while the Weave Net
  plugin is running causes Docker 1.10.0 to fail to start #1959/#1963

Also one other small fix:

* Avoid a hang when trying to use plugin and proxy at the same time
  #1956/#1961

## Release 1.4.3

Preparing for Docker 1.10, plus some bug-fixes.

* Avoid hang in Docker v1.10 on `docker volume ls` after `weave stop`,
  `weave stop-plugin` or `weave reset` #1934/#1936
* Fix "unexpected EOF" from Docker 1.10 on `docker exec` with Weave
  proxy `--rewrite-inspect` enabled #1911/#1917
* Avoid losing DNS entries and potentially double-allocating IP
  Addresses allocated via plugin, on router restart; also extend
  `weave ps` to show IP addresses allocated via plugin #1745/#1921
* Stop creating lots of copies of `weavewait` program in Docker
  volumes #1757/#1935
* Prevent container starting prematurely when proxy in
`--no-multicast-route` mode #1942/#1943
* Log error message from plugin rather than crashing when weave not
  running #1906/#1918
* Warn, don't error, if unable to remove plugin network in 'weave
  stop', to avoid breaking the usual upgrade or config change process
  #1900/#1919
* Don't crash if network conditions suggest only very small packets
  will get through #1905/#1926
* Cope with unexpected errors during route traversal when starting
  container via proxy #1909/#1910/#1932

## Release 1.4.2

Bug-fixes and minor improvements.

* A race condition in weavewait that would occasionally hang
  containers at startup #1882/#1884
* Having the plugin auto-restart prevents successful `weave launch` on
  reboot #1869
* Work round weave router failure on CoreOS 4.3 caused by kernel bug
  #1854
* `weave launch` would exit with error code on docker <1.9 #1851
* Running `eval $(weave env)` multiple times would break `eval $(weave
  env --restore)` #1824/#1825
* Don't complain in `weave stop` about "Plugin is not running" when
  plugin is not enabled #1840/#1841
* `weave --local launch` would fail if utility program
  `docker_tls_args` could not be found #1844
* Improved error reporting when TLS arg detection fails #1843
* Improve error reporting when docker isn't running #1845
* Add `--trusted-subnets` usage to `weave` script #1842
* weave run can hang under rare combinations of options #1858

## Release 1.4.1

This is a bug-fix release to cover a few issues that came up since the
release of 1.4.0.

* Weave would fail to launch when `$DOCKER_HOST` was set to a TCP socket secured with TLS #1820/#1822
* Weave would fail to stop when run against Docker pre-1.9 #1815/#1817
* Issue a warning instead of failing on `--with-dns` option to proxy, which was removed #1810/#1812
* Make `weave version` show the plugin version #1797/#1813
* Make `weave launch` show when the a container is restarting #1778/#1814
* Make `weave launch` fail if the plugin is running, for consistency with router and proxy. #1818/#1819

More details in the [change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.4.1).

## Release 1.4.0

**Highlights**

* The Docker Network plugin can now operate without a cluster store, so it is now run by default.
* You can now use the fast datapath over trusted links and Weave encryption over untrusted links, in the same network.

Plus many bug fixes and minor enhancements. More details below and in
the [change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.4.0).

## Release 1.3.1

**Highlights**

* The minimum Docker version has been increased to 1.6 due to the
  [upcoming deprecation of Dockerhub access](https://blog.docker.com/2015/10/docker-hub-deprecation-1-5/)
  for old clients. From December 7th onwards previous versions of the
  `weave` script will fail to pull down images from the hub; if you
  are unable to upgrade to 1.3.1 immediately you can work around this
  by running `weave --local setup` in conjunction with a compatible
  Docker client installation
* Docker networking plugin now works with older kernels and allows you
  to configure the MTU

More details in the
[change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.3.1).

## Release 1.3.0

**Highlights**

This release includes a Docker Plugin, so you have the option to use
Weave Net that way. More details in the
[change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.3.0).

## Release 1.2.1

This release contains a number of bug fixes and minor
enhancements. More details in the
[change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.2.1).

The release is fully compatible with 1.2.0 versions, so existing
clusters can be upgraded incrementally.

## Release 1.2.0

**Highlights**

This release introduces the 
[Fast Data Path](http://docs.weave.works/weave/master/head/features.html#fast-data-path),
which allows Weave networks to operate at near wire-level speeds. This
new feature is enabled by default.

Other highlights:

- auto-configuration of TLS for the Weave Docker API proxy, making it
  easier to run Weave on Macs and in conjunction with tools like
  Docker Swarm
- support for restart policies on application containers and weave
  infrastructure containers
- better compatibility with recent and future Docker versions

More details in the 
[change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.2.0).

## Release 1.1.2

This release contains a small number of bug fixes. More details in the
[change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.1.2).

The release is fully compatible with 1.1.0 versions, so existing
clusters can be upgraded incrementally. When upgrading from 1.0.x,
note the compatibility information in the
[Installation & Upgrading instructions for Weave 1.1.0](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/tag/v1.1.0).

## Release 1.1.1

This release contains a number of bug fixes and minor
enhancements. More details in the
[change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.1.1).

The release is fully compatible with 1.1.0 versions, so existing
clusters can be upgraded incrementally. When upgrading from 1.0.x,
note the compatibility information in the
[Installation & Upgrading instructions for Weave 1.1.0](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/tag/v1.1.0).

## Release v1.1.0

**Highlights**:

- `weave launch` now launches all weave components, simplifying
  startup.
- `weave status` has been completely revamped, with a much improved
  presentation of the information, and the option to select and output
  data in JSON.
- weaveDNS has been rewritten and embedded in the router. The new
  implementation simplifies configuration, improves performance, and
  provides fault resilience for services.
- the weave Docker API proxy now provides an even more seamless user
  experience, and enables easier integration of weave with other
  systems such as kubernetes.
- many usability improvements
- a few minor bug fixes, including a couple of security
  vulnerabilities

More details in the
[change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.1.0).

## Release 1.0.3

This release contains a weaveDNS feature enhancement as well as minor fixes for
improved stability and robustness.

More details in the
[change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.0.3).

The release is fully compatible with other 1.0.x versions, so existing
clusters can be upgraded incrementally.

## Release 1.0.2

This release fixes a number of bugs, including some security
vulnerabilities in the Weave Docker API proxy, hangs and failures in
address allocation, and sporadic failures in name resolution.

More details in the
[change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.0.2).

The release is fully compatible with other 1.0.x versions, so existing
clusters can be upgraded incrementally.

## Release 1.0.1

This is a bug fix release, addressing the following issue:

- executing `docker run` from a Docker 1.7 client against the weave
  proxy would report a `no such image` error when the requested image
  wasn't present on the Docker host, instead of downloading it.

## Release 1.0.0

**Highlights**:

- It is now easier than ever to start containers and for them to
  communicate, across multiple hosts. Automatic IP address allocation,
  and name resolution via weaveDNS are now enabled by default, and the
  proxy has become more fully-featured. In short, once weave has been
  launched the following is possible:

      ````
      host1$ docker run --name=pingme -dti ubuntu
      host2$ docker run -ti ubuntu
      root@d11e9287f65b:/# ping pingme
      ````
- Containers can now be
  [load-balanced](http://docs.weave.works/weave/latest_release/weavedns.html#load-balancing)
  easily.
- IP address allocation is now available across [multiple
  subnets](http://docs.weave.works/weave/latest_release/ipam.html#range),
  and hence can be employed when running multiple, isolated
  applications.
- The proxy now supports [TLS
  connections](http://docs.weave.works/weave/latest_release/proxy.html#tls),
  enabling its deployment when the communication between docker
  clients and the server must be secured.

There are many other new features, plus the usual assortment of bug
fixes and improvements under the hood. More detail below and in the
[change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.0.0).

*NB: This release changes the weave protocol version. Therefore, when
 upgrading an existing installation, all hosts need to be upgraded in
 order to for them to be able to communicate and form a network.*

## Release 0.11.2

This is a bug fix release, addressing the following issues:

- `weave run` did not respect DOCKER_CLIENT_ARGS. #855
- Negative result cache did not expire if requeried within TTL. #845

More details in the [change
log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A0.11.2).

*NB: This release does not change the weave protocol version.
Therefore, when upgrading an existing 0.11 installation incrementally,
connectivity between peers will be retained.*

## Release 0.11.1

This is a bug fix release, addressing the following issues:

- The IP Allocator could crash in some relatively rare
  circumstances. #782/#783.
- When the proxy failed to attach a container to the weave network,
  there was no failure indication and descriptive error anywhere, and
  the application process would still start. Now an error is reported
  to the client (i.e. typically the Docker CLI), recorded in the proxy
  logs, and the container is terminated. #788/#799.
- `weave launch-proxy --with-ipam` failed to configure the entrypoint
  and DNS unless a (possibly blank) `WEAVE_CIDR` was
  specified. Affected containers could start the application process
  w/o the weave network interface being available, and without
  functioning name resolution for the weaveDNS domain.
  #744/#747/#751/#752
- The `weave status` output for the IP Allocator was misleadingly
  conveying a sense of brokenness when no IP allocation requests had
  been made yet. #787/#801
- When invoking `weave launch-proxy` twice, the second invocation
  would output a blank line and terminate with a success exit
  status. Now it reports that the proxy is already running and exits
  with a non-zero status. #767/#780
- `weave launch-proxy` was not respecting WEAVEPROXY_DOCKER_ARGS, so
  any user-supplied custom configuration for the weaveproxy container
  was ignored. #755/#780
- The proxy was not intercepting API calls to the unversioned (1.0)
  Docker Remote API. Hence none of the weave functionality was
  available when Docker clients were using that version of the
  API. #770/#774/#777,#809
- The proxy would crash when certain elements of the
  `/containers/create` JSON were missing. We are not aware of any
  Docker clients doing this, but it's been fixed regardless. #778/#777

More details in the [change
log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A0.11.1).

*NB: This release does not change the weave protocol version.
Therefore, when upgrading an existing 0.11 installation incrementally,
connectivity between peers will be retained.*

## Release 0.11.0

**Highlights**:

- **automatic IP Address Management (IPAM)**, which allows application
  containers to be started and attached to the weave network without
  needing to supply an IP address.
- **proxy** for automatically attaching containers started with
  ordinary `docker run`, or the Docker remote API, to the weave
  network.
- ability to **add/remove extra DNS records**.
- performance and scalability improvements
- fixes for a small number of bugs discovered during testing

More detail in the [change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A0.11.0)

*NB: This release changes the weave protocol version. Therefore, when
upgrading an existing installation, all hosts need to be upgraded in
order to for them to be able to communicate and form a network.*

## Release 0.10.0

**Highlights**:

- **bug fixes**, in particular eradicating several deadlocks that could
  cause peer connection failures and hangs.
- **performance and scalability improvements** to the weave control plane,
  as a result of which it is now possible to construct much larger
  weave networks than previously.
- **improved installation and administration**, particularly the
  introduction of remote execution of the weave script in a container,
  permitting fully containerised deployment of weave.
- **improved diagnostics**, such as the reporting of connection failures
  in `weave status`.
- **new weaveDNS features**, most notably the caching of DNS records
  for application containers, which makes finding container IP
  addresses via weaveDNS much faster.

More detail in the [change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A0.10.0)

*NB: This release changes the Weave Docker image names. To upgrade
from an older version, 1) stop all application containers, 2) run
`weave reset` from the old version to remove all traces of weave, and
only then 3) install the new version.*

## Release 0.9.0

- Improve WeaveDNS to the point where it can act as the name server
  for containers in nearly all situations.

- Diagnose and report peer connectivity more comprehensively.

- Adapt to changes in topology - adding & removing of weave peers,
  disruption of connectivity - more rapidly.

- Cope with delays in downloading/running docker images/containers
  required for weave operation.

See the
[complete change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A0.9.0)
for more details.

## Release 0.8.0

- Align script and image version. When the `weave` script has a
  version number, i.e. it is part of an official release, it runs
  docker images matching that version. Thus the script and image
  versions are automatically aligned. Unversioned/unreleased `weave`
  scripts run the 'latest'-tagged image versions.

- Eliminate dependency on ethtool and conntrack. Instead of requiring
  these to be installed on the host, weave invokes them via a
  `weavetools` docker image that contains minimally packaged versions
  of these utilities.

- New `weave setup` command. This downloads all docker images used by
  weave. Invoking this is strictly optional; its main purpose is to
  facilitate automated installation of weave and preventing delays in
  subsequent weave command execution due to image downloading.

## Release 0.7.0

This is the first release assigned a version number.

When downloading weave you now have the following choices...

1. a specific version, e.g. https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/v0.7.0/weave
2. latest released version: https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/latest_release/weave
3. most recent 'master' commit: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaveworks/weave/master/weave

Previously the only documented download location was (3). We recommend
that any automated scripts using that be changed to either (1) or (2).
