# ReWeave - an effort to keep Weave Net alive

This repository contains a fork of Weave Net, the first product developed by Weaveworks. Since Weaveworks has shut down, this repo aims to continue maintaining Weave Net, and to publish releases regularly.

## Using Weave Net on Kubernetes

On a newly created Kubernetes cluster, the Weave Net CNI pluging can be installed by running the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f https://reweave.azurewebsites.net/k8s/v1.28/net.yaml
```

Replace `v1.28` with the version on Kubernetes on your cluster.

That endpoint is provided by the companion project [weave-endpoint](https://github.com/rajch/weave-endpoint).

## Using Weave Net in other ways

Please refer to the [documentation](https://rajch.github.io/weave).

## Building Weave Net

Details can be found [here](reweave/BUILDING.md). 

## Documentation status

The public documentation that used to exist in the `site` directory has been moved to the `original/site` directory. A new `website` directory has been created, and populated with the content of the `original/site` directory, rearranged and reformatted for being built with Jekyll and published to the GitHub pages site [https://rajch.github.io/weave](https://rajch.github.io/weave).

The documentation will now be maintained and published from the `website` directory exclusively.
