# AWSVPC

# Urgent

* Add the subnet checks / keep checksum offloading for the plugin
* Test with the plugin

* Test with multiple addr from the default subnet

* Create new SSH keys or reuse the same for each test run

# Nice To Have

* What happens if $RCIDR is not found
* Do fuzz testing
* Read on VPC routing tables again.
* create a separate VPC for each test run
