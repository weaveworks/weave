# Changelog

All changes made to the weave net codebase during the reweave effort will be documented in this file.

## latest

### Changed

* Changed the CNI version configured in the `weave` script to `1.0.0`, as per [this](https://www.cni.dev/docs/spec/#configuration-format)
* Ensured that the weave version gets added to `weaveutil` via linker flag

## 2.8.4-beta1 (bcab10a4)

### Changed
* Added tracing The `launch.sh` and `init.sh` scripts if the WEAVE_DEBUG environment variable is set.
* When publishing images, the `:latest` tag is also applied. It will not be applied any more if the tag includes "-beta" anywhere.

### Fixed

* The Alpine Linux base image had been upgraded to 3.19.1. In this version, the default iptables backend is nftables, and the legacy backend is not included by default. Our scripts and programs assume legacy as the default backend, and change to nft if autodetected, or if we ask for it. So, changed our build script to install the Alpine `iptables-legacy` package, and changed the symbolic links to point to the legacy backend by default.

## 2.8.3 (d0878790)

### Changed

* Changed version in `reweave/Makefile` to 2.8.3
* Modified reweave and main CHANGELOG.md
* Modified the `weave` script

## 2.8.3-beta1 (a752f656)

### Changed

* The docker API client version, used by the proxy package and the weaveutil command, was bumped from 1.18 to 1.24. As of March 2024, Docker API versions below 1.24 are deprecated. This means that the minimum supported Docker version is now 1.12.0
* The scan report now scans all images other than the V2 Docker plugin

### Added

* Provision was made in weaveutil program and the weave script to override the API version used, via the environment variable `DOCKER_API_VERSION`. The same variable is used by standard docker clients

### Fixed

* Fixed `proxy.go` in the proxy package to handle changes in the Docker API. In the 1.24 API, container objects expose a `.Mounts` property rather than a `.Volumes` property.
* The `weave` script was modified to add a `-t` switch when invoking functionality inside a container. This ensures that output is visible even when using the Weave docker proxy

## 2.8.2 (7b087168)
