# Automatic IP Address Management

Weave automatically assigns containers an IP address that is unique
across the network, and releases that address when a container
exits. This happens for all invocations of the `run`, `start`,
`attach`, `detach`, `expose`, and `hide` commands, unless
the user explictly specified an address. Weave can also assign
addresses in multiple subnets.

## <a name="initialisation"></a>Initialisation

Just once, when the first automatic IP address allocation is requested
in the whole network, weave needs a majority of peers to be present in
order to avoid formation of isolated groups, which could lead to
inconsistency, i.e. the same IP address being allocated to two
different containers. Therefore, you must either supply the list of
all peers in the network to `weave launch` or add the
`--init-peer-count` flag to specify how many peers there will be.

To illustrate, suppose you have three hosts, accessible to each other
as `$HOST1`, `$HOST2` and `$HOST3`. You can start weave on those three
hosts with these three commands:

    host1$ weave launch $HOST2 $HOST3

    host2$ weave launch $HOST1 $HOST3

    host3$ weave launch $HOST1 $HOST2

Or, if it is not convenient to name all the other hosts at launch
time, you can give the number of peers like this:

    host1$ weave launch --init-peer-count 3

    host2$ weave launch --init-peer-count 3 $HOST3

    host3$ weave launch --init-peer-count 3 $HOST2

The consensus mechanism used to determine a majority transitions
through three states: 'deferred', 'waiting' and 'achieved':

* 'deferred' - no allocation requests or claims have been made yet;
  consensus is deferred until then
* 'waiting' - an attempt to achieve consensus is ongoing, triggered by
  an allocation or claim request; allocations will block. This state
  persists until a quorum of peers are able to communicate amongst
  themselves successfully
* 'achieved' - consensus achieved; allocations proceed normally

### More on `--init-peer-count`

TL;DR: it isn't a problem to over-estimate by a bit, but if you supply
a number that is too small then multiple independent groups may form.

Weave uses the estimate of the number of peers at initialization to
compute a majority or quorum number - specifically floor(n/2) + 1. So,
if the actual number of peers is less than half the number stated then
they will keep waiting for someone else to join to reach a quorum.  On
the other hand, if the actual number is more than twice the quorum
number then you could have two sets of peers each reach a quorum and
initialize independent data structures. You'd have to be quite unlucky
for that to happen in practice, as they have to go through the whole
agreement process without learning about each other, but it's
definitely possible.

The quorum number is only used once at start-up (specifically, the
first time someone tries to allocate or claim an IP address), so once
a set of peers is initialized you can add more and they will join on
to the data structure used by the existing set.  The one thing you
have to watch is if the early ones get restarted, you must restart
them with the current number of peers - if they use the smaller number
that was correct when they first started then they could form an
independent set again.

To illustrate this last point, the following sequence of operations
would be safe wrt weave's startup quorum:

    host1$ weave launch
    ...time passes...
    host2$ weave launch $HOST1
    ...time passes...
    host3$ weave launch $HOST1 $HOST2
    ...time passes...
    ...host1 is rebooted...
    host1$ weave launch $HOST2 $HOST3

## <a name="range"></a>Choosing an allocation range

By default, weave will allocate IP addresses in the 10.32.0.0/12
range. This can be overridden with the `--ipalloc-range` option, e.g.

    host1$ weave launch --ipalloc-range 10.2.0.0/16

and must be the same on every host.

> The specified range is for *exclusive* use by the IP allocator. In
> particular, when starting containers with manually assigned IP
> addresses, these must be outside the IP allocator's range.  If, in
> our example, you subsequently executed `docker run -e
> WEAVE_CIDR=10.2.3.1/24 -ti ubuntu`, the IP allocator might assign
> the same address to another container, which will break IP routing
> for the containers sharing an address.

The range parameter is written in
[CIDR notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) -
in this example "/16" means the first 16 bits of the address form the
network address and the allocator is to allocate container addresses
that all start 10.2. The ".0" and ".-1" addresses in a subnet are not
used, as required by
[RFC 1122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122#page-29).

Weave shares the IP address range across all peers, dynamically
according to their needs.  If a group of peers becomes isolated from
the rest (a partition), they can continue to work with the address
ranges they had before isolation, and can subsequently be re-connected
to the rest of the network without any conflicts arising.

## <a name="subnets"></a>Automatic allocation across multiple subnets

When
[running containers on different subnets](features.html#application-isolation),
you may wish to request the allocation of an address from a particular
subnet. This is done by specifying the subnet with `net:<subnet>`, in
CIDR notation, e.g.

    host1$ docker run -e WEAVE_CIDR=net:10.2.7.0/24 -ti ubuntu

You can ask for multiple addresses in different subnets and add in
manually-assigned addresses (outside the automatic allocation range),
for instance:

    host1$ docker run -e WEAVE_CIDR="net:10.2.7.0/24 net:10.2.8.0/24 ip:10.3.9.1/24" -ti ubuntu

When working with multiple subnets in this way, it is usually
desirable to constrain the default subnet - i.e. the one chosen by the
allocator when no subnet is supplied - so that it does not overlap
with others. One can specify that with `--ipalloc-default-subnet`:

    host1$ weave launch --ipalloc-range 10.2.0.0/16 --ipalloc-default-subnet 10.2.3.0/24

`--ipalloc-range` should cover the entire range that you will ever use
for allocation, and `--ipalloc-default-subnet` is the subnet that will
be used when you don't explicitly specify one.

When specifying addresses, the default subnet can be denoted
symbolically with `net:default`.

## <a name="manual"></a>Mixing automatic and manual allocation

If you want to start containers with a mixture of
automatically-allocated addresses and manually-chosen addresses, *and
have the containers communicate with each other*, you can choose a
`--ipalloc-range` that is smaller than `--ip-default-subnet`, For
example, if you launch weave with:

    host1$ weave launch --ipalloc-range 10.9.0.0/17 --ipalloc-default-subnet 10.9.0.0/16

then you can run all containers in the 10.9.0.0/16 subnet, with
automatic allocation using the lower half, leaving the upper half free
for manual allocation.

## <a name="stop"></a>Stopping and removing peers

You may wish to `weave stop` and re-launch to change some config or to
upgrade to a new version; provided the underlying protocol hasn't
changed it will pick up where it left off and learn from peers in the
network which address ranges it was previously using. If, however, you
run `weave reset` this will remove the peer from the network so
if Weave is run again on that node it will start from scratch.

For failed peers, the `weave rmpeer` command can be used to
permanently remove the ranges allocated to said peer.  This will allow
other peers to allocate IPs in the ranges previously owner by the rm'd
peer, and as such should be used with extreme caution - if the rm'd
peer had transferred some range of IP addresses to another peer but
this is not known to the whole network, or if it later rejoins
the Weave network, the same IP address may be allocated twice.

Assuming we had started the three peers in the example earlier, and
host3 has caught fire, we can go to one of the other hosts and run:

    host1$ weave rmpeer host3

Weave will take all the IP address ranges owned by host3 and transfer
them to be owned by host1. The name "host3" is resolved via the
'nickname' feature of weave, which defaults to the local host
name. Alternatively, one can supply a peer name as shown in `weave
status`.

## <a name="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting

The command

    weave status

reports on the current status of the weave router and IP allocator:

````
...

       Service: ipam
     Consensus: waiting(quorum: 2, known: 0)
         Range: [10.32.0.0-10.48.0.0)
 DefaultSubnet: 10.32.0.0/12

...
````

The first section covers the router; see the [troubleshooting
guide](troubleshooting.html#weave-status) for full details.

The 'Service: ipam' section displays the consensus state as well as
the total allocation range and default subnet.
