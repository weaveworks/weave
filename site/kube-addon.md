## <a name="install"></a> Installation

Weave Net can be installed onto your CNI-enabled Kubernetes cluster
with a single command:

```
$ kubectl apply -n kube-system -f "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=$(kubectl version | base64 | tr -d '\n')"
```

After a few seconds, a Weave Net pod should be running on each
Node and any further pods you create will be automatically attached to the Weave
network.

**Note:** This command requires Kubernetes 1.4 or later, and we
recommend your master node has at least two CPU cores.

> CNI, the [_Container Network Interface_](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni),
> is a proposed standard for configuring network interfaces for Linux
> containers.
>
> If you do not already have a CNI-enabled cluster, you can bootstrap
> one easily with
> [kubeadm](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/).
>
> Alternatively, you can [configure CNI yourself](http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/network-plugins/#cni)

**Note:** If using the [Weave CNI
Plugin](/site/cni-plugin.md) from a prior full install of Weave Net with your
cluster, you must first uninstall it before applying the Weave-kube addon.
Shut down Kubernetes, and _on all nodes_ perform the following:

 * `weave reset`
 * Remove any separate provisions you may have made to run Weave at
   boot-time, e.g. `systemd` units
 * `rm /opt/cni/bin/weave-*`

Then relaunch Kubernetes and install the addon as described
above.

**Note:** The URLs:

- [https://git.io/weave-kube](https://git.io/weave-kube), and
- [https://git.io/weave-kube-1.6](https://git.io/weave-kube-1.6)

point to:

- [https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/v1.5/net](https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/v1.5/net), and
- [https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/v1.6/net](https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/v1.6/net).

In the past, these URLs pointed to the static YAML files for the [latest release](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/tag/latest_release) of the Weave Net addon, respectively:

- [`latest_release/weave-daemonset.yaml`](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/latest_release/weave-daemonset.yaml) and
- [`latest_release/weave-daemonset-k8s-1.6.yaml`](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/latest_release/weave-daemonset-k8s-1.6.yaml).

## <a name="kube-1.6-upgrade"></a> Upgrading Kubernetes to version 1.6

In version 1.6, Kubernetes has increased security, so we need to
create a special service account to run Weave Net. This is done in
the file `weave-daemonset-k8s-1.6.yaml` attached to the [Weave Net
release](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/latest).

Also, the
[toleration](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/taint-toleration-dedicated.md)
required to let Weave Net run on master nodes has moved from an
annotation to a field on the DaemonSet spec object.

If you have edited the Weave Net DaemonSet from a previous release,
you will need to re-make your changes against the new version.

### <a name="daemon-sets"></a> Upgrading the Daemon Sets

Kubernetes does not currently support rolling upgrades of daemon sets,
and so you will need to perform the procedure manually:

* Apply the updated addon manifest `kubectl apply -f https://git.io/weave-kube`
* Kill each Weave Net pod with `kubectl delete` and then wait for it to reboot before moving on to the next pod.

**Note:** If you delete all Weave Net pods at the same time they will
  lose track of IP address range ownership, possibly leading to
  duplicate IP addresses if you then start a new copy of Weave Net.

## <a name="resources"></a>CPU and Memory Requirements

Kubernetes manages
[resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/)
on each node, and only schedules pods to run on nodes that have enough
free resources.

The components of a typical Kubernetes installation (with the master
node running etcd, scheduler, api-server, etc.) take up about 95% of a
CPU, which leaves little room to run anything else. For all of Weave
Net's features to work, it must run on every node, including the
master.

The best way to resolve this issue is to use machines with at least
two CPU cores. However if you are installing Kubernetes and Weave Net
for the first time, you may not be aware of this requirement. For this
reason, Weave Net launches as a DaemonSet with a specification that
reserves at least 1% CPU for each container. This enables Weave Net to
start up seamlessly on a single-CPU node.

Depending on the workload, Weave Net may need more than 1% of the
CPU. The percentage set in the DaemonSet is the minimum and not a
limit. This minimum setting allows Weave Net to take advantage of
available CPU and "burst" above that limit if it needs to.

## <a name="eviction"></a>Pod Eviction

If a node runs out of CPU, memory or disk, Kubernetes may [decide to
evict](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/out-of-resource/)
one or more pods. It may choose to evict the Weave Net pod, which will
disrupt pod network operations.

You can reduce the chance of eviction by changing the DaemonSet to
have a much bigger request, and a limit of the same value.

This causes Kubernetes to apply a ["guaranteed" rather than a
"burstable" policy](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/resource-qos.md).
However a similar request for disk space can not
be made, and so please be aware of this issue and monitor your
resources to ensure that they stay below 100%.

You can see when pods have been evicted via the `kubectl get events` command

```
LASTSEEN   COUNT     NAME          KIND    TYPE      REASON     SOURCE            MESSAGE
1m         1         mypod-09vkd   Pod     Warning   Evicted    kubelet, node-1   The node was low on resource: memory.
```

or `kubectl get pods`

```
NAME                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP          NODE
mypod-09vkd         0/1       Evicted   0          1h        <none>      node-1
```

If you see this in your cluster, consider some of the above steps to
reduce disruption.

## <a name="npc"></a>Network Policy Controller

The addon also supports the [Kubernetes policy
API](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/networkpolicies/) so that
you can securely isolate pods from each other based on namespaces and
labels. For more information on configuring network policies in
Kubernetes see the
[walkthrough](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/network-policy/walkthrough/)
and the [NetworkPolicy API object
definition](http://kubernetes.io/docs/api-reference/extensions/v1beta1/definitions/#_v1beta1_networkpolicy).

**Note:** as of version 1.9 of Weave Net, the Network Policy
  Controller allows all multicast traffic. Since a single multicast
  address may be used by multiple pods, we cannot implement rules to
  isolate them individually.  You can turn this behaviour off (block
  all multicast traffic) by adding `--allow-mcast` as an argument to
  `weave-npc` in the YAML configuration.

### <a name="blocked-connections"></a> Troubleshooting Blocked Connections

If you suspect that legitimate traffic is being blocked by the Weave Network Policy Controller, the first thing to do is check the `weave-npc` container's logs.

To do this, first you have to find the name of the Weave Net pod running on the relevant host:

```
$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system -o wide | grep weave-net
weave-net-08y45                  2/2       Running   0          1m        10.128.0.2   host1
weave-net-2zuhy                  2/2       Running   0          1m        10.128.0.4   host3
weave-net-oai50                  2/2       Running   0          1m        10.128.0.3   host2
```

Select the relevant container, for example, if you want to look at host2 then pick `weave-net-oai50` and run:

```
$ kubectl logs <weave-pod-name-as-above> -n kube-system weave-npc
```

When the Weave Network Policy Controller blocks a connection, it logs the following details about it:

* protocol used, 
* source IP and port, 
* destination IP and port, 

as per the below example:

```
TCP connection from 10.32.0.7:56648 to 10.32.0.11:80 blocked by Weave NPC.
UDP connection from 10.32.0.7:56648 to 10.32.0.11:80 blocked by Weave NPC.
```

### <a name="configuration-options"></a> Changing Configuration Options

#### Using `cloud.weave.works`

If the YAML file is from `cloud.weave.works` as described above, then you can customise it by passing some of Weave Net's options, arguments and environment variables as query parameters:

  - `version`: Weave Net's version. Default: `latest`, i.e. latest release. *N.B.*: This only changes the specified version inside the generated YAML file, it does not ensure that the rest of the YAML is compatible with that version. To freeze the YAML version save a copy of the YAML file from the [release page](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases) and use that copy instead of downloading it each time from `cloud.weave.works`.
  - `known-peers`: comma-separated list of hosts. Default: empty.
  - `trusted-subnets`: comma-separated list of CIDRs. Default: empty.
  - `disable-npc`: boolean (`true|false`). Default: `false`.
  - `env.NAME=VALUE`: add environment variable `NAME` and set it to `VALUE`.

The list of variables you can set is:

* `CHECKPOINT_DISABLE` - if set to 1, disable checking for new Weave Net
  versions (default is blank, i.e. check is enabled)
* `IPALLOC_RANGE` - the range of IP addresses used by Weave Net
  and the subnet they are placed in (CIDR format; default `10.32.0.0/12`)
* `EXPECT_NPC` - set to 0 to disable Network Policy Controller (default is on)
* `KUBE_PEERS` - list of addresses of peers in the Kubernetes cluster
  (default is to fetch the list from the api-server)
* `IPALLOC_INIT` - set the initialization mode of the [IP Address
  Manager](/site/operational-guide/concepts.md#ip-address-manager)
  (defaults to consensus amongst the `KUBE_PEERS`)
* `WEAVE_EXPOSE_IP` - set the IP address used as a gateway from the
  Weave network to the host network - this is useful if you are
  configuring the addon as a static pod.
* `WEAVE_MTU` - Weave Net defaults to 1376 bytes, but you can set a
  smaller size if your underlying network has a tighter limit, or set
  a larger size for better performance if your network supports jumbo
  frames - see [here](/site/using-weave/fastdp.md#mtu) for more
  details.
* `HAIRPIN_MODE` - Weave Net defaults to enabling hairpin on the bridge side of
  the `veth` pair for containers attached. If you need to disable hairpin, e.g. your
  kernel is one of those that can panic if hairpin is enabled, then you can disable it
  by setting `HAIRPIN_MODE=false`.

Example:
```
$ kubectl apply -n kube-system -f "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=$(kubectl version | base64 | tr -d '\n')&env.WEAVE_MTU=1337"
```
This command -- notice `&env.WEAVE_MTU=1337` at the end of the URL -- generates a YAML file containing, among others:

```
[...]
          containers:
            - name: weave
[...]
              env:
                - name: WEAVE_MTU
                  value: '1337'
[...]
```

**Note**: The YAML file can also be saved for later use or manual editing by using, for example:
```
$ curl -fsSLo weave-daemonset.yaml "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=$(kubectl version | base64 | tr -d '\n')"
```

#### Manually editing the YAML file

Whether you saved the YAML file served from `cloud.weave.works` or downloaded a static YAML file from our [releases page](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases), you can manually edit it to suit your needs.

For example,
- additional arguments may be supplied to the Weave router process by adding them to the `command:` array in the YAML file,
- additional parameters can be set via the environment variables listed above; these can be inserted into the YAML file like this:

```
      containers:
        - name: weave
          env:
            - name: IPALLOC_RANGE
              value: 10.0.0.0/16
```
