Two endpoints are exposed: one for the Weave Net router, and, when deployed as
a [Kubernetes Addon](/site/kube-addon.md), one for the [network policy
controller](/site/kube-addon.md#npc).

### Router Metrics

The endpoint address is `localhost:6782`; the following metrics are
exposed:

* `weave_connections` - Number of peer-to-peer connections.
* `weave_connection_terminations_total` - Number of peer-to-peer
  connections terminated.
* `weave_ips` - Number of IP addresses.
* `weave_max_ips` - Size of IP address space used by allocator.
* `weave_dns_entries` - Number of DNS entries.
* `weave_flows` - Number of FastDP flows.

#### Publish Router Metrics Endpoint

By default, when started via `weave launch`, weave listens on its local 
interface to serve metrics. To publish your metrics throughout your cluster, 
e.g. if your prometheus server is installed on a different host machine,
you need to set `WEAVE_STATUS_ADDR` to your corresponding IP and port.
Default port is 6782.

`WEAVE_STATUS_ADDR=X.X.X.X:PORT`

You can set `WEAVE_STATUS_ADDR=0.0.0.0:6782` to listen on all interfaces, 
but be aware, this may expose your metrics to the public internet.

### Kubernetes Network Policy Controller Metrics

The endpoint address is `localhost:6781`; the following metric is
exposed:

* `weavenpc_blocked_connections_total` - Connection attempts blocked
  by policy controller.

# Static Configuration for Weave Net

The following YAML fragment can be used in your Prometheus configuration to
scrape the router metrics endpoint:

```
scrape_configs:
- job_name: 'weave'
  scrape_interval: 15s
  static_configs:
  - targets: ['localhost:6782']
```

# Discovery Configuration for Kubernetes

If you're running Weave in conjunction with Kubernetes, it is possible
to discover the endpoints for all nodes automatically. The following
Kubernetes config will install and configure Prometheus 1.3 on your
cluster and configure it to discover and scrape the Weave endpoints:

```
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: prometheus
data:
  prometheus.yml: |-
    global:
      scrape_interval: 15s
    scrape_configs:
    - job_name: 'weave'
      kubernetes_sd_configs:

      relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_namespace,__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_name]
        action: keep
        regex: ^kube-system;weave-net$
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_name,__address__]
        action: replace
        target_label: __address__
        regex: ^weave;(.+?)(?::\d+)?$
        replacement: $1:6782
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_name,__address__]
        action: replace
        target_label: __address__
        regex: ^weave-npc;(.+?)(?::\d+)?$
        replacement: $1:6781

        volumeMounts:

          mountPath: /etc/prometheus
      volumes:
      - name: config-volume
        configMap:
          name: prometheus
```

# Weave Cloud Integration

Finally, you can configure your local Prometheus instance to push
metrics to Weave Cloud by including the following fragment in the
`prometheus.yml` above (after replacing `<WEAVE_CLOUD_TOKEN>` with
your own token):

```
remote_write:
  url: http://frontend.dev.weave.works/api/prom/push
  basic_auth:
    password: <WEAVE_CLOUD_TOKEN>
```

For information on getting started with Weave Cloud metrics, including
