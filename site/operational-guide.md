This operational guide is intended to give you an overview of how to operate and manage a Weave Network in production. 

Topics discussed in this section include: 

 * **[Concepts](/site/operational-guide/concepts.md)**— Begin here for an overview of the terminology as well as the general concepts behind container networking with Weave Net. 
 * **[Interactive Deployment](/site/operational-guide/interactive.md)** – Describes what interactive mode is, when to use it, and also explains how to get up and running quickly with Weave Net. 
 * **[Uniform Fixed Cluster](/site/operational-guide/uniform-fixed-cluster.md)** – Using a simple deployment scenario, where the number of nodes is equal to 1, and all peers have identical configuration, this section describes how to manually bootstrap, add, and remove peers. 
 * **[Autoscaling](/site/operational-guide/autoscaling.md)** – Using with a fixed cluster, how to bootstrap peers, and also how to scale them in and out is described. 
 * **[Uniform Dynamic Cluster](/site/operational-guide/uniform-dynamic-cluster.md)** – In this deployment scenario,  where the number of nodes is equal to 1, and all peers have identical configuration, bootstrapping, adding, removing peers through an automated script is described. 
 * **[Tasks](/site/operational-guide/tasks.md)** – Common administrative tasks such configuring Weave Net to start at boot, upgrading clusters, cleaning up peers, and reclaiming IP address space are described.
