The command

    weave status

reports on the current status of the weave router and IP allocator:

```
...
       Service: ipam
        Status: awaiting consensus (quorum: 2, known: 0)
         Range: 10.32.0.0-10.47.255.255
 DefaultSubnet: 10.32.0.0/12
...
```

The first section covers the router; see the [troubleshooting
guide](/site/troubleshooting.md#weave-status) for full details.

The 'Service: ipam' section displays the consensus state as well as
the total allocation range and default subnet. Columns are as follows:

* 'Status' - allocator state
    * 'idle' - no allocation requests or claims have been made yet;
      consensus is deferred until then
    * 'awaiting consensus' - an attempt to achieve consensus is
      ongoing, triggered by an allocation or claim request;
      allocations will block.  This state persists until a quorum of
      peers are able to communicate amongst themselves successfully.
    * 'priming' - peer is an observer and is waiting to receive IPAM
      data from seeding or consensus elsewhere in the network
    * 'ready' - consensus achieved; allocations proceed normally
    * 'waiting for IP range grant from peers' - peer has exhausted its
      agreed portion of the range and is waiting to be granted some
      more
    * 'all IP ranges owned by unreachable peers' - peer has exhausted
      its agreed portion of the range but cannot reach anyone to ask
      for more
* 'Range' - total allocation range set by `--ipalloc-range`
* 'DefaultSubnet' - default subnet set by `--ipalloc-default-subnet`

Information regarding the division of the IP allocation range amongst
peers and their reachability can be obtained with

```
$ weave status ipam
00:00:00:00:00:01(one)      349526 IPs (33.3% of total) (2 active)
00:00:00:00:00:02(two)      349525 IPs (33.3% of total)
00:00:00:00:00:03(three)    349525 IPs (33.3% of total) - unreachable!
```

Columns are as follows:

* Peer Name and Nickname
* Absolute quantity/percentage of allocation range managed by peer
* Active - number of IP addresses in use on that peer - this is only
  available for the peer where you run the status command.
* Indication of unreachability. This means that the peer is not
  visible (directly or indirectly) to the peer on which `weave status
  ipam` was run; whilst this could be a transient condition due to a
  partition, it may be because the peer has failed and needs to be
  removed administratively - see [Starting, Stopping and Removing
  Peers](/site/tasks/ipam/stop-remove-peers-ipam.md) for more details.


### <a name="seeded-different-peers"></a>Seeded by Different Peers

If you see the message: `IP allocation was seeded by different peers`,
this means that some Weave Net peers were initialized into one cluster
and some into another cluster; Weave Net cannot operate in this state.

To recover, you need to eliminate the IPAM data from the affected
nodes and restart.  If you installed via the Kubernetes Addon, this
data will be in a file under `/var/lib/weave` on the node - delete
this file and restart the node.

For other installations, run `weave reset` and restart. Any existing
connections to containers will be lost.
