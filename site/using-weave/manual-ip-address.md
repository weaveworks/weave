title: Manually Specifying the IP Address of a Container
layout: default
---

Containers are automatically allocated an IP address that is unique across the Weave network. You can see which address was allocated by running, [`weave ps`](/site/troubleshooting.md#weave-status):

    host1$ weave ps a1
    a7aee7233393 7a:44:d3:11:10:70 10.32.0.2/12

Weave detects when a container has exited and releases its allocated addresses so they can be re-used by the network.

See the [Automatic IP Address Management](/site/ipam/overview-init-ipam.md) and also an explanation of [the basics of IP addressing](/site/ip-addresses/ip-addresses.md) for further details.

Instead of allowing Weave to allocate IP addresses automatically (using IPAM), there may be instances where you need to control a particular container or a cluster by setting an IP address for it.  

You can specify an IP address and a network explicitly, using Classless Inter-Domain Routing or [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing).

For example, in the example, $HOST1 and $HOST2, in CIDR notation you could run your containers as follows:

On `$HOST1`:

~~~bash
host1$ Docker run -e WEAVE_CIDR=10.2.1.1/24 -ti ubuntu
root@7ca0f6ecf59f:/#
~~~

And $HOST2:

~~~bash
host2$ Docker run -e WEAVE_CIDR=10.2.1.2/24 -ti ubuntu
root@04c4831fafd3:/#
~~~

Then test that the container on $HOST2 can be reached:

~~~bash
root@7ca0f6ecf59f:/# ping -c 1 -q 10.2.1.2
PING 10.2.1.2 (10.2.1.2): 48 data bytes
--- 10.2.1.2 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 1.048/1.048/1.048/0.000 ms
~~~

And do the same in the container on $HOST1:

~~~bash
root@04c4831fafd3:/# ping -c 1 -q 10.2.1.1
PING 10.2.1.1 (10.2.1.1): 48 data bytes
--- 10.2.1.1 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 1.034/1.034/1.034/0.000 ms
~~~

The IP addresses and netmasks can be set to anything, but ensure they donâ€™t conflict with any of the IP ranges in use on the hosts or with IP addresses used by any external services to which the hosts or containers may need to connect. 

Individual IP addresses given to containers must, of course, be unique. If you pick an address that the automatic allocator has already assigned a warning appears.
